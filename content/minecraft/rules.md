Title: Old Folks Minecraft Server Rules
---

More tbd, but here's what I have so far:

1. We're all adults here, respect each other. No theft, no pvp, no griefing unless explicitly agreed to.

2. This is intended as a vanilla survival multiplayer experience, please  keep to that spirit. Avoid exploiting bugs such item-dupes, x-ray tools, etc.

3. The large mushroom island is reserved for community development. This spawn island should be considered a safe place.
